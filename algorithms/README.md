Variant 3 — Shortest Path Performance in Large Graphs

**Goal**: Empirically compare Dijkstra’s algorithm and BFS (for unweighted graphs) in terms of runtime and scalability.

**_Tasks_**

1. Generate random graphs with varying sizes and edge weights.
2. Run BFS for unweighted graphs and Dijkstra for weighted graphs.
3. Measure execution time and number of operations as input size grows.
4. Plot results and analyze when Dijkstra’s overhead becomes significant.
